# kdist
simple script for provisioning, configuration management, and deployment

Templates are stored in directory $HOME/kdist/

To create an empty template directory structure, do:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/kdist/my-template/{0-execute-before,1-install,2-transfer,3-execute-after}
```

The template directory structure looks like this:

```
0-execute-before: commands to be executed before

1-install: packages to install

2-transfer: files to copy

3-execute-after: commands to be executed after
```
